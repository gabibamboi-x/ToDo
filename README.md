## Lessons Learned

Building this project allowed me get a better understanding of the DOM and helped me improve my debugging skills. I have tried separating each module to have their own scope, it sure helps, can be a little confusing sometimes tho, nonetheless it has been an awesome experience and i'm looking forward to build my next project.
